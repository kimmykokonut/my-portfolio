### About

- My Goal: to create a portfolio with only Html and CSS to make it more accessible to screen readers.
- I am taking a Responsive Web Design Course via FreeCodeCamp and wanted to see after my courses using React and design libraries like Tailwind and Material UI, I wanted to take a step back and build my portfolio without all the easy helpers. (though I miss them already!)
- Project is 1 HTML file and 1 CSS file, using aria-labels and other tags to increase accessibility.

* Warning: does Not look good on mobile view. Current design is for iPad or laptop/desktop

### Stretch Goals:
* Visual modes: dark mode
* Animation? Background image tree with paths to sections along roots...
* Css stying to be more responsive for mobile view.
* Make header to turn into hamburger at phone/tablet size
* Snap scroll not working?
